In this project, there will be a full detailed explanation on how SQL was used for all the investigative process and clues gotten to solve the murder mystery and discover the murderer.

There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.
